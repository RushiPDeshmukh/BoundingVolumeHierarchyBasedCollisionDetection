# BoundingVolumeHierarchyBasedCollisionDetection
Bounding Volume Hierarchy is used to represent the objects in a 3D euclidean space. Collision Detection between this complex detailed structures is implemented in this project. This algorithm is fast, modular and generalised. It can be used with different types of bounding volume and the premitive tests. It can be expanded to the 3D 6DoF interactions from the current 2D 2DoF version.
